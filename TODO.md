- TODO: Produce some stats after the clustering stage: (1) how many clusters, (2) how large is the -1 cluster compared to the other clusters, (3) the avg size of the non -1 clusters. If some of these metrics are off, circle back to the generation stage and generate more.

- TODO: Implement the ICL example generation. Maybe just base the examples on the domain and info about the task.
