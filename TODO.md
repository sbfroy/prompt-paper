- TODO: Implement something that tracks all the individuals and their ids throughout the evolution. This way I can later see how much of the whole example pool was explored, but also make a cool visualization of the evolution.

- TODO: Produce some stats after the clustering stage: (1) how many clusters, (2) how large is the -1 cluster compared to the other clusters, (3) the avg size of the non -1 clusters
